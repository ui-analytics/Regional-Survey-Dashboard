• County sample size bar chart
• Well-being quadrant scatter plot (Life Sat. vs. Social Support)
• Demographic pie charts (age, race, employment)

How to Use:
1. Start here to get a sense of the overall data
2. Note the average life satisfaction (typically 5-7 out of 10)
3. Check the well-being quadrant to see distribution patterns:
   - Top right (Thriving): High satisfaction + high support
   - Top left (Satisfied but Isolated): High satisfaction + low support
   - Bottom right (Connected but Struggling): Low satisfaction + high support
   - Bottom left (Vulnerable): Low satisfaction + low support
4. Review demographic composition in pie charts

Key Insights to Look For:
• Is life satisfaction normally distributed or skewed?
• Which counties have larger/smaller samples?
• Where do most respondents fall in the well-being quadrant?
• What's the demographic composition of your sample?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏘️ GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS PAGE
----------------------------

What You'll See:
• Metric selector dropdown (choose what to analyze)
• County ranking bar chart with confidence intervals
• Rankings table with color-coded values
• Multi-metric heatmap showing all counties
• Zip code analysis (top 20 by life satisfaction)

How to Use:
1. Select a metric from the dropdown (e.g., "Life Satisfaction")
2. Review county rankings - darker green = better, darker red = worse
3. Look at error bars for confidence intervals (wider = less certain)
4. Check the heatmap to compare counties across multiple metrics
5. Scroll to zip code section for more granular geographic patterns

Key Insights to Look For:
• Which counties rank highest/lowest?
• Are urban or rural counties doing better?
• How wide are the confidence intervals? (more data = narrower)
• Do certain metrics cluster together geographically?

Interpretation Tips:
• Counties with <300 responses have wider confidence intervals

4. FILTER GUIDE
═══════════════

Understanding Filters
---------------------
Filters let you focus your analysis on specific subgroups. All visualizations 
update in real-time when you change filters.

County Filter
-------------
Options: All, Anson, Cabarrus, Catawba, Chester, Cleveland, Gaston, Iredell, 
         Lancaster, Lincoln, Mecklenburg, Rowan, Stanly, Union, York

Use When:
• Comparing a specific county to regional average
• Analyzing patterns within a county
• Creating county-specific reports

Example: Select "Mecklenburg" to see how Charlotte's urban core differs from 
the regional average.

Age Group Filter
----------------
Options: All, 18-24, 25-39, 40-54, 55-65, 65+

Use When:
• Understanding generational differences
• Targeting age-specific programs
• Analyzing life stage effects

Example: Compare "18-24" to "65+" to see how well-being differs between young 
adults and seniors.

Race/Ethnicity Filter
---------------------
Options: All, Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Other, White

Use When:
• Examining equity and disparities
• Understanding diverse community experiences
• Targeting culturally-specific interventions

Example: Select "Black/African American" to analyze well-being patterns in 
this community.

Combining Filters
-----------------
You can use multiple filters simultaneously for very specific analyses.

Examples:
• County: Mecklenburg + Age: 25-39 + Race: All
  → Young professionals in Charlotte urban core

• County: Anson + Age: 65+ + Race: All
  → Seniors in a rural county

• County: All + Age: All + Race: Hispanic/Latino
  → Hispanic/Latino community across entire region

Tips for Effective Filtering:
• Start broad ("All") then narrow down
• Watch the sample size indicator - need sufficient N for reliability
• Compare filtered view to "All" to see differences
• Try unexpected combinations to discover patterns

Sample Size Guidelines:
• N > 200: Reliable for most analyses
• N = 100-200: Use with caution, wider confidence intervals
• N = 50-100: Descriptive only, unreliable for inference
• N < 50: Too small for meaningful analysis

5. VISUALIZATION TYPES EXPLAINED
═════════════════════════════════

The dashboard uses various chart types, each suited for different purposes.

Bar Charts
----------
Purpose: Compare values across categories
Best For: Rankings, group comparisons, frequencies
How to Read:
• Taller bars = higher values
• Colors indicate magnitude (green=good, red=concerning)
• Hover for exact values and sample sizes

Example: County rankings for life satisfaction

Histograms
----------
Purpose: Show distribution shape and frequency
Best For: Understanding score distributions, identifying outliers
How to Read:
• X-axis: Score/value bins
• Y-axis: Count of respondents
• Dashed line: Mean value
• Shape reveals normal, skewed, or bimodal distributions

Example: Life satisfaction distribution (0-10 scale)

Scatter Plots
-------------
Purpose: Show relationships between two continuous variables
Best For: Correlation analysis, identifying patterns
How to Read:
• Each dot = one respondent
• Trendline shows direction and strength of relationship
• Correlation coefficient (r) in title indicates strength
• Color/size can add additional dimensions

Example: Life satisfaction vs. Social support

Violin Plots
------------
Purpose: Compare distributions across groups
Best For: Seeing both central tendency AND spread
How to Read:
• Width = frequency at that value (wider = more common)
• White dot = median
• Box = interquartile range (middle 50%)
• Thinner ends = fewer observations

Example: Life satisfaction distribution by age group

Pie Charts
----------
Purpose: Show proportions of a whole
Best For: Composition, demographic breakdowns
How to Read:
• Each slice = percentage of total
• Labels show category and percentage
• Larger slices = larger proportions

Example: Employment status distribution

Heatmaps
--------
Purpose: Show values across two dimensions
Best For: Comparing many groups/variables simultaneously
How to Read:
• Each cell = a value (e.g., average score)
• Color intensity = magnitude (darker = higher/lower depending on scale)
• Red-Yellow-Green scale common (red=low, green=high)
• Numbers in cells show exact values

Example: Life satisfaction by Age × Income

Line Charts
-----------
Purpose: Show trends across ordered categories
Best For: Income gradients, age trends
How to Read:
• X-axis: Ordered categories (e.g., income levels)
• Y-axis: Metric value
• Line slope shows direction and rate of change
• Multiple lines allow comparison across metrics

Example: Well-being metrics across income levels

Grouped Bar Charts
------------------
Purpose: Compare multiple metrics across groups simultaneously
Best For: Multi-dimensional comparisons
How to Read:
• Groups of bars for each category
• Different colors = different metrics
• Height = value
• Legend identifies which bar is which metric

Example: Well-being scores (4 metrics) by demographic group

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

6. INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES
═════════════════════════════

Understanding Scales
--------------------

0-10 Scales (Life Satisfaction, Trust, etc.):
• 0-3: Low (concerning)
• 4-6: Moderate (average)
• 7-10: High (positive)

• Mean of 5.0 = neutral midpoint
• Mean of 6.0-7.0 = typical for well-being research
• Mean of 8.0+ = unusually high
• Mean below 5.0 = concerning

1-5 Ordinal Scales (Belonging, Confidence):
• 1: Very weak/low
• 2: Somewhat weak/low
• 3: Moderate/neutral
• 4: Somewhat strong/high
• 5: Very strong/high

Statistical Significance
------------------------

P-values (from ANOVA tests):
• p < 0.05: Statistically significant (*) - 95% confident difference is real
• p < 0.01: Highly significant (**) - 99% confident
• p < 0.001: Very highly significant (***) - 99.9% confident
• p ≥ 0.05: Not significant - could be due to chance

Important: Statistical significance ≠ practical significance!
A tiny difference can be statistically significant with large sample sizes.

Correlation Coefficients (r):
• r = 0.0-0.3: Weak correlation
• r = 0.3-0.5: Moderate correlation
• r = 0.5-0.7: Strong correlation
• r = 0.7-1.0: Very strong correlation
• Negative values indicate inverse relationships

Effect Sizes
------------

When comparing groups:
• Difference of 0.2 points on 0-10 scale: Very small
• Difference of 0.5 points: Small but noticeable
• Difference of 1.0 points: Moderate
• Difference of 2.0+ points: Large and meaningful

Confidence Intervals
--------------------

Error bars on charts show 95% confidence intervals:
• Wider bars = less certainty (smaller sample or more variability)
• Narrower bars = more certainty
• Non-overlapping intervals suggest significant difference
• Overlapping intervals suggest groups may not differ

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
------------------------

1. Confusing Correlation with Causation
   ✗ "High income causes happiness"
   ✓ "High income is associated with higher life satisfaction"

2. Ignoring Sample Size
   ✗ Using results from N=20 as definitive
   ✓ Noting that small samples have wider confidence intervals

3. Cherry-Picking Results
   ✗ Only reporting findings that match expectations
   ✓ Presenting full picture, including unexpected results

4. Over-Interpreting Small Differences
   ✗ "6.2 vs 6.3 is a meaningful difference"
   ✓ Considering both statistical AND practical significance

5. Forgetting This is Simulated Data
   ✗ Using for actual policy recommendations
   ✓ Using for teaching, exploration, and methodology testing
