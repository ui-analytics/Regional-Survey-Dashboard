CHARLOTTE REGIONAL WELL-BEING SURVEY
SIMULATED DATASET DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This simulated dataset contains 5,000 survey responses representing adult 
residents across the 14-county Charlotte metropolitan region. The data was 
generated to provide realistic distributions and relationships for well-being 
research and analysis.

GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE
-------------------
14 Counties:
North Carolina: Anson, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cleveland, Gaston, Iredell, Lincoln,
                Mecklenburg, Rowan, Stanly, Union
South Carolina: Chester, Lancaster, York

SAMPLING STRATEGY
-----------------
The dataset employs stratified sampling with oversampling for smaller counties:

1. Minimum Sample: 200 responses per county (ensures county-level analysis)
2. Proportional Allocation: Remaining responses allocated by population
3. Final Distribution:
   - Mecklenburg (largest): 1,026 responses (20.5%)
   - Anson (smallest): 216 responses (4.3%)
   - All counties have sufficient N for statistical analysis

DATA GENERATION METHODOLOGY
---------------------------

1. DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS

Age Distribution:
- Based on Charlotte metro census data with slight aging adjustment for survey 
  respondent bias
- Distribution: 18-24 (12%), 25-39 (28%), 40-54 (28%), 55-65 (18%), 65+ (14%)

Race/Ethnicity:
- Varies by county reflecting actual demographic patterns
- Mecklenburg (most diverse): 50% White, 30% Black, 14% Hispanic, 5% Asian
- Suburban counties (Union, Cabarrus): ~75% White, 12% Black, 10% Hispanic
- Rural counties with historical Black populations (Anson, Chester): ~50/45 White/Black
- Generated using county-specific probability distributions

Income:
- Correlated with:
  * County (urban/suburban counties higher)
  * Age (U-shaped: lowest for young adults, peaks mid-career, declines in retirement)
  * Race/ethnicity (reflects documented income inequality)
  * Employment status
- Distribution mirrors regional patterns with ~8% refusing/don't know

Employment:
- Age-dependent probabilities
- Young adults: higher part-time, some unemployment
- Middle-aged: predominantly full-time
- 55-65: mixture with increasing retirement
- 65+: predominantly retired

2. WELL-BEING MEASURES

Life Satisfaction (LIFESAS, 0-10 scale):
- Mean: ~6.8, SD: ~1.9
- Based on research showing average life satisfaction around 7 in developed nations
- Influenced by:
  * Income (higher income → higher satisfaction)
  * Employment (unemployment → -1.5 points)
  * Age (U-shaped: lower for middle-aged, higher for retirees)
- Range: 0-10

Worthwhileness (LIFEWW):
- Highly correlated with life satisfaction (r≈0.85)
- Slightly higher mean than life satisfaction
- Generated as life satisfaction ± random adjustment

Social Support (BELONGNEED, 0-10 scale):
- Moderate correlation with life satisfaction (r≈0.45)
- Mean: ~7.2, reflects generally strong family/friend networks
- Generated as correlated with life satisfaction with added noise

Trust (TRUST, 0-10 scale):
- Moderate correlation with life satisfaction (r≈0.40)
- Mean: ~6.0, reflects moderate trust levels
- Generated as weighted function of life satisfaction

Sense of Belonging:
- Ordinal scale (Very Weak to Very Strong)
- Varies by county type:
  * Urban (Mecklenburg): More "weak" responses
  * Rural/small town: Stronger community belonging
  * Suburban: Middle ground

3. REGIONAL PRIORITIES AND OUTLOOK

Top Problems (up to 3 selections):
- Weighted probabilities based on regional concerns:
  * Housing affordability: 30% mention rate
  * Crime/safety: 28%
  * Economic opportunity: 20%
  * Public education: 22%
  * Transportation: 20%
- Independent selection per respondent

Regional Outlook (3-4 years):
- Slightly pessimistic distribution:
  * Better: 25%
  * Worse: 35%
  * Same: 30%
  * Don't know: 10%

4. FINANCIAL WELL-BEING

Change vs. Year Ago:
- Correlated with employment status and income
- Unemployed: 60% worse off
- High income: 35% better off
- Middle: balanced distribution

Emergency Expense Confidence:
- Strong correlation with income
- Low income (<$35k): 65% not/slightly confident
- High income ($100k+): 78% very/completely confident

5. SOCIAL CONNECTION

Meals (Q56, Q57):
- Days per week eating each meal (0-7)
- Breakfast mean: 4.5 days/week
- Lunch mean: 6.0 days/week
- Dinner mean: 6.5 days/week
- Meals with others: ~40% of total meal occasions
- Binomial distribution based on meal frequency

6. NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY

Environmental Problems:
- Urban counties report more issues
- Mecklenburg, Gaston, Cabarrus: Higher problem rates
- Rural counties: Lower problem rates

Safety:
- Day vs. night difference
- Urban areas: Lower safety perceptions, especially at night
- Mecklenburg: More variation, 8% feel unsafe at night
- Rural/suburban: Generally higher safety perceptions

7. HOUSING

Housing Situation Severity (0-10):
- Urban counties: Mean ~7.5 (serious problem)
- Rural counties: Mean ~4.5 (moderate problem)
- Correlated with income (lower income sees it as more severe)

Housing Affordability Reasons:
- Multiple selections allowed
- Top reasons (by selection rate):
  * Not enough housing built: 28%

- Belonging: Rural > Urban

RESEARCH LITERATURE BASIS
--------------------------

Well-being measures based on:
- ONS4 well-being questions (UK Office for National Statistics)
- World Values Survey trust measures
- Happiness research showing life satisfaction mean ~7, SD ~2
- Income-happiness correlation research (Kahneman & Deaton, 2010)
- Age-happiness U-curve literature (Blanchflower & Oswald, 2008)

Demographic patterns based on:
- U.S. Census Bureau ACS 2019-2023 estimates
- Charlotte Regional Indicators Project data
- North Carolina and South Carolina state demographics

Regional context based on:
- Charlotte area housing affordability crisis (2020-2024)
- Regional crime statistics and perceptions
- Transportation challenges in growing metro areas
- Educational quality variations across counties

LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
-----------------------

1. Simulated Data: This is NOT real survey data. All responses are generated 
   algorithmically based on research literature and demographic patterns.

2. Simplified Relationships: Real human behavior is more complex than the 
   correlations programmed into this dataset.

3. Missing Nuance: County-level variations are approximated based on broad 
   demographic categories rather than detailed local knowledge.

4. Temporal Validity: Patterns reflect 2024-2025 conditions and may not apply 
   to other time periods.

5. Cultural Factors: The model doesn't capture all cultural, historical, and 
   social factors that influence well-being and attitudes.

6. Survey Mode Effects: Real surveys have mode effects, non-response bias, and 
   measurement error not fully reflected here.

RECOMMENDED USES
----------------

✓ Teaching survey analysis and statistical methods
✓ Testing data analysis workflows and visualization techniques
✓ Practicing multilevel modeling with county-level predictors
✓ Developing well-being indicators and composite measures
✓ Prototyping dashboards and reporting tools
✓ Understanding relationships between well-being domains

✗ Making actual policy recommendations
✗ Publishing as real survey findings
✗ Inferring causation (correlations are built-in, not discovered)
✗ Generalizing to actual Charlotte residents' views
